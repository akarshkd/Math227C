# Math 227C: Stochastic modeling and statistical modeling for the life sciences

![Teams for today](./teams_M227C.svg)

* The repository will be updated throughout the course, including with lecture notes. A convenient way to rapidly synchronize a copy onto your computer is using git, available openly online.
* In the second part of the course, we will make use of Jupyter notebooks and the R programming language. We plan to start using Jupyter around the 5th week of class. There are (at least) three ways to run Jupyter R notebooks. 
  - Install Jupyter and R on your machine is through Anaconda, available openly online, by first [installing Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) and then [installing R](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/working-with-conda/packages/using-r-language/). 
  - Use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
  - For UCI students, use our local high-performance computing facility, hpc3, which has a Jupyter notebook server called [biojhub](https://hpc3.rcic.uci.edu/biojhub4/hub/login). See some [instructions from rcic](https://rcic.uci.edu/slurm/examples.html#jupyterhub-portal).  
  - Use R-lang Jupyter in [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (a free text editor made by Microsoft). <!-- This [tutorial](https://www.practicaldatascience.org/html/jupyter_r_notebooks.html) worked for me. -->
* In the first part of the course, a good tool for typesetting mathematical homeworks is LaTeX. A good tutorial to learn LaTeX is [here](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Tutorials).
* R learning resources
  - [R Tutorial from W3C](https://www.w3schools.com/r/)
  - [R cheatsheet](https://iqss.github.io/dss-workshops/R/Rintro/base-r-cheat-sheet.pdf) with loops, if statements, `lapply`, etc. 

## Premise

This course follows MATH 227A and 227B in establishing mathematical and computational tools that are useful in modeling the dynamics of biological systems. This course, MATH 227C, is in two parts: the first covers stochastic processes, where randomness plays a role in the system behavior; the second covers statistical modeling, where models, including their attributes such as parameters, are learned from data in the presence of noise or inherent randomness in the model.

## Scheduling


Special dates

- There will be no lecture Wednesday, April 17th (wk 3). 
- There will be no lecture Monday, May 13th (wk 7).
