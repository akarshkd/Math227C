%\item % uncomments for multi-problem homeworks
The DNA sequence of a gene determines the amino acid sequence of the protein it produces, with every 3 DNA basepairs coding for one protein amino acid.
In eukaryotes, predicting the protein sequence from a gene sequence is not as simple as taking the gene sequence and splitting it into 3's, because of \emph{introns}, stretches of gene sequence that do not code for amino acids. 
(The regions of DNA in a gene that are not introns are called exons.)

A Markov chain model has been used to detect introns, assuming the 6 states shown in the diagram. 
The index set here does not represent time, but rather represents basepairs: Each increment is the transition from the previous basepair to the neighboring basepair.

\begin{enumerate}[i. ]
\item Suppose a newly-discovered species has the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
\item The average protein is $L_{\rm g} = 20000$ amino acids long (i.e., it is 60,000 basepairs long, not counting introns).
\item The average protein-coding gene has $N_I=10$ introns.
\item The average intron is $L_I=6000$ basepairs long. 
\end{itemize}
Write the 6-state Markov transition matrix. The matrix should contain numerical values (e.g., expressed as a fraction or decimal). 
\item Under the assumptions of this model, what is the average length of a gene, including introns?
\end{enumerate}
